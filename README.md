# Prediction of Configuration Space of Dual-Arm Robot via Convolutional Encoder-Decoders

## Contributions 
- First to apply a CNN to predict robotic configuration spaces from robotic worksapces. 
- Our model learns highly transferable features between robotic workspaces allowing the model to quickly adapt to translation, rotation, and removal of the obstacles from the workspaces.
- The time taken for our prediction of the configuration space image is independent of the number and shape of obstacles  
- Curate 4 datasets for the study of of configuration space images from robotic workspace images.
